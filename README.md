# Employee-Retention-Classification

This repository contains my code for Project 3: Employee Retention, part of the Machine Learning Masterclass offered by EliteDataScience.

The goal of this project is to develop an employee retention classification model that predicts the probability of an employee leaving the company.

The repository contains the following Python code:

* Module 1 - Exploratory Analysis.ipynb
* Module 2 - ABT Construction.ipynb
* Module 3 - Classification Algorithms.ipynb
* Module 4 - Model Training.ipynb
* Module 5 - Project Delivery.ipynb

The raw data set used for the modules is in project_files/employee_data.csv. The data dictionary is called Project-3-Data-Dictionary.pdf

The remaining objects in this repository are either intermediate copies of data tables created in the Modules, the final model created in Module 4 (final_model.pkl), or back-up copies of data.

To get started with this repo, review the data dictionary and begin with Module 1. For a more guided introduction through the project, I highly recommend checking out EliteDataScience's Machine Learning Masterclass.
